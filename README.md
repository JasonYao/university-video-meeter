# University Video Web App (Name to be added later)
By Jason Yao & Arvind Ramgopal

## Description
This is a web application that will allow students
applying to university a chance to learn more about
the institutions that they can be attending.

For universities, it allows another facet to high
school outreach and understanding.

For high school students, it offers a real look
into university life by current students, enabling
the student to make more of an informed decision
regarding which university they choose to attend.

For the current university students, it allows
them a way to form mentorship relationships
with future students at their university,
enriching the time they have left at university
by building friendships and relationships
past graduation.

For us, the developers, it allows us to showcase
our full-stack knowledge, and build out a cool,
full web app using as many of the latest technologies
as we could fit into it.
